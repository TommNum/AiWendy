# Implementing Wendy with G.A.M.E Framework and Twitter Plugin

Based on the requirements, I'll outline how to implement Wendy using the G.A.M.E Framework with the TwitterPlugin. Let me structure this for you:

## Architecture Overview

Wendy will be implemented with the following components:

```
Wendy Agent
├── Personality Module (defined in agent configuration)
├── Plan Module (defined in agent configuration)
└── Workers
    ├── PostTweetWorker (tweets every 2 hours)
    ├── SearchTweetsWorker (searches every 60 seconds)
    ├── ReplyToMentionsWorker (replies to @AIWendy mentions)
    └── DMManagerWorker (handles DMs)
```
