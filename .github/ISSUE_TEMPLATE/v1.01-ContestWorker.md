## Document Information
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** Current Date  
**Product:** Wendy AI Twitter Agent  
**Feature:** Contest Monitoring and Winner Selection Worker  

## Feature Overview
Develop a specialized worker within the Wendy AI Twitter agent that automatically monitors a specific Twitter account for contest announcements, quotes these contests with promotional messaging, and selects random winners based on specified criteria after the contest deadline.

## Business Requirements
- Automate contest promotion to increase engagement with the @AIWendy account
- Provide fair and transparent winner selection for contests posted by @CultureCapFun
- Maintain Wendy's unique personality and voice in all interactions
- Increase user participation in the CultureCap ecosystem through Vesting Token distribution

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Contest Monitoring Worker

#### 1.1 Account Monitoring
- **Description:** Create a worker that specifically monitors the @CultureCapFun Twitter account

  - Add robust error handling for API failures with exponential backoff strategy
  - Implement logging for monitoring purposes with clear event tracking

#### 1.2 Contest Detection
- **Description:** Worker must identify tweets containing the word "contest"
- **Tasks:**
  - Create a function to analyze tweet content for the keyword "contest" (case-insensitive)
  - Add natural language processing to identify contest-related phrases even when the exact word might be missing
  - Implement a validation system to prevent duplicate processing of the same contest
  - Create a persistent storage mechanism to track previously identified contests
  - Add detailed logging of contest detection events

### 2. Contest Promotion

#### 2.1 Quote Tweet Functionality
- **Description:** Worker must quote tweet identified contest tweets
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement quote tweet functionality using the TwitterPlugin API
  - Ensure proper error handling and retry logic if the quote tweet fails
  - Add rate limiting to comply with Twitter API constraints
  - Implement logging to track successful and failed quote tweets

#### 2.2 Promotional Message
- **Description:** Worker must craft a promotional message about Vesting Tokens in Wendy's voice
- **Tasks:**
  - Create a template system for promotional messages that maintains Wendy's unique voice
  - Implement variations in messaging to avoid repetitive content
  - Ensure messages adhere to Twitter character limits
  - Include proper formatting according to Wendy's style guide (lowercase, limited emoji use, etc.)
  - Implement validation to ensure messages match Wendy's personality profile

### 3. Contest Deadline Detection

#### 3.1 Deadline Parsing
- **Description:** Worker must extract deadline information from contest tweets
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement natural language processing to identify deadline phrases (e.g., "ends tomorrow", "closes on Friday", "24 hours")
  - Create a date/time parser to convert text deadlines into actual timestamps
  - Implement fallback logic for ambiguous or missing deadline information
  - Add validation to ensure extracted deadlines are in the future
  - Implement logging of parsed deadlines for verification

#### 3.2 Deadline Tracking
- **Description:** Worker must schedule winner selection based on parsed deadlines
- **Tasks:**
  - Create a scheduling system that triggers winner selection at deadline time
  - Implement persistent storage of contest deadlines to survive service restarts
  - Add timezone handling to ensure deadlines are interpreted correctly
  - Implement failsafes for missed deadlines due to service outages
  - Add logging of scheduled events and execution

### 4. Winner Selection

#### 4.1 Reply Gathering
- **Description:** Worker must gather all replies to the original contest tweet
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement functionality to fetch all replies to a specific tweet using Twitter API
  - Handle pagination for contests with large numbers of replies
  - Add proper error handling for API limitations and rate limiting
  - Implement retry logic for temporary API failures
  - Create logging for reply collection process

#### 4.2 Criteria Filtering
- **Description:** Worker must filter replies based on criteria mentioned in Wendy's quote tweet
- **Tasks:**
  - Create a parsing system to extract criteria from Wendy's quote tweet
  - Implement filtering logic to evaluate if replies meet the specified criteria
  - Create fallback mechanisms for ambiguous criteria
  - Implement validation to ensure criteria evaluation is consistent
  - Add detailed logging of criteria evaluation process

#### 4.3 Random Winner Selection
- **Description:** Worker must randomly select a winner from qualifying replies
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement cryptographically secure random selection algorithm
  - Create verification methods to prove selection was truly random
  - Add functionality to select alternate winners if needed
  - Implement logging of the selection process with timestamps
  - Store winner information for future reference

#### 4.4 Winner Announcement
- **Description:** Worker must announce the winner via a reply to the original contest tweet
- **Tasks:**
  - Implement reply functionality using the TwitterPlugin API
  - Create announcement templates in Wendy's voice
  - Include proper mentioning of the winner's Twitter handle
  - Add logic to handle potential API failures during announcement
  - Implement logging of winner announcements

## Technical Constraints

1. **Framework Requirements:**
   - Must use the G.A.M.E Framework architecture
   - Must utilize the TwitterPlugin for all Twitter interactions
   - Must follow worker/agent pattern as established in the codebase

2. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Account monitoring: Once every 15 minutes
   - Quote tweeting: Maximum 1 per hour
   - Reply fetching: Respect Twitter API rate limits with exponential backoff
   - Winner announcement: Maximum 1 per contest

3. **Error Handling:**
   - All Twitter API interactions must include proper error handling
   - Service must be resilient to temporary Twitter outages
   - Failed operations must be retried with appropriate backoff strategy

4. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - All worker actions must be logged with appropriate detail level
   - Critical events must trigger alerts
   - Logging should include contest IDs, deadlines, and winner selection details
   - Must integrate with Railway's logging system

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Coding Standards:**
   - Follow established project coding conventions
   - Add comprehensive comments explaining complex logic
   - Mark potential enhancement points with `// TODO: Enhancement opportunity` comments

2. **Testing Requirements:**
