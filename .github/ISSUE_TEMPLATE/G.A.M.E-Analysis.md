## Framework Selection Analysis
The G.A.M.E Framework from Virtuals appears to be the ideal choice for this implementation because:

It provides a structured way to create agents with workers 
It includes a TwitterPlugin that handles API authentication and rate limiting as well as native client that gives enterprise X access
It supports the Docker deployment model you need for Railway
It has an existing GitHub repository you've already forked which is here (https://github.com/game-by-virtuals/game-node)


## Requirements
- We must use the source protocol we install here: npm install @virtuals-protocol/game
- We must use the native twitter client descrives in @twitterclient 
- We must create our own directroy that mimics the @examples directory
